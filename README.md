## 2. Objective  
The main goal is to understand the global distribution of mental health disorders by analyzing:
- Countries with the highest burden of mental illness  
- Yearly trends in depression  
- Disorders such as drug abuse, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and eating disorders  

## 3. Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains country-level and year-level information on various mental health conditions. It includes:

- Depression rates  
- Bipolar disorder cases  
- Schizophrenia prevalence  
- Drug use disorder metrics  
- Eating disorder statistics  

### Key Dimensions:
- Country  
- Year  
- Disorder Type  
- Population counts or standardized prevalence  

## 4. Methodology  
1. Data was sourced and filtered by country and year  
2. Disorders were categorized and aggregated for comparison  
3. Visualizations were created to display trends and top rankings  
4. Disorders were compared across countries for correlation analysis  

## 5. Research Questions  
- Which countries report the highest number of mental health disorders?  
- What years show the highest reported depression rates?  
- Which countries have the highest rate of specific disorders like schizophrenia or drug use?  
- What are the long-term trends in bipolar disorder?  
- Are there regional concentrations of particular disorders?

## 6. Process  
- Grouped data by disorder type and summarized totals  
- Used horizontal and vertical bar charts for clarity  
- Filtered and ranked the top 10 entities (countries or years) in each disorder type  
- Mapped yearly trends in bipolar disorder  

## 7. Insights  
- Zimbabwe and Zambia show the highest number of mental health disorders  
- The year 1997 reported the peak in depression rates  
- USA leads in drug use disorders by a significant margin  
- Bipolar disorder has maintained consistent rates over years with slight fluctuations  
- Schizophrenia is most prominent in regions including Uzbekistan, Tunisia, and Slovakia  
- Eating disorders are widespread, with notable cases in Canada, Israel, and Uruguay  

## 8. Key Findings  
- **Mental Health Disorders**: African and South American nations show large disorder burdens  
- **Depression**: Peaks around the late 1990s to early 2000s  
- **Drug Use**: USA stands out significantly  
- **Bipolar Disorder**: Annual totals remain steady with no major spike  
- **Schizophrenia**: Prevalent in several geographically diverse nations  
- **Eating Disorders**: Present across various continents, with developed countries showing high counts  

## 9. Conclusion  
This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of global mental health disorder trends. The findings suggest that mental health challenges are widespread and vary by region and disorder type. The consistency in bipolar disorder and rise in depression in certain periods may indicate a need for more targeted mental health interventions. Public health stakeholders can use these insights to prioritize resources and policies for mental health support.
